#Blackjack game using Python
This is a blackjack game created using my add'l lanuage, Python.
The game works the same as the one in Ruby with a few exceptions.
First, the game begins when you click on the 'hit' button. This game doesn't do the 
first two hits automatically.

I have yet to implement a 'first_hit' method which automatically deals the player two cards
to begin the game. 

The same 'first_hit' method has not been applied to the dealer.

The game runs, but it does not run well.

Text appears when the 21 point cap has been breached, clarifying who won.

The point system is a bit off. For example, the player with the most points win, regardless 
of the fact that the points have gone higher than 21.
